## ⚠️ **IDENTIFIED RISK SCENARIOS**

### **Challenging Conditions (35% of scenarios)**
```
Risk Factors:
• Launch phase (<10K users): Insufficient community value
• Severe bear markets: 50-70% investment reduction
• High competition: Community value factor drops to 0.4-0.6x
• Platform maturity: Creator expectations increase to $4-5 RPM
• Market crashes: Investment conversion drops to 10-20%
```

### **Mitigation Strategies**
```
Launch Phase:
• Start with hybrid model (community + 20% external revenue)
• Target 15K+ DAU before pure community mode
• Build 6-month creator payment reserve

Bear Market Protection:
• Maintain 6-12 month reserve fund
• Reduce target RPM to $2.5 during crisis
• Increase inflation to 10-12% if needed

Competition Response:
• Focus on unique value propositions
• Build strong creator loyalty programs
• Continuous platform innovation

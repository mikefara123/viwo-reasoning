## üéØ **Key Features Implemented**

### **1. Dynamic Reward Adjustment**

**Your Requirement**: "When price is $1, earn 100 tokens. When price is $10, earn 30 tokens."

**Implementation**:
- **Formula**: Uses adjustable factor (default 0.3) to reduce rewards as price appreciates
- **Protection**: Floor at 20% and ceiling at 200% of base rewards
- **Real-Time**: Updates instantly as you change token price
- **Visual**: Chart shows reward curve across price ranges

### **2. Reasonable Burn Mechanisms**

**Your Requirement**: "Basic burning mechanisms"

**Implementation**:
- **6 utility-driven burns** tied to real platform activity
- **Revenue-backed**: Burns funded by actual economic value
- **Proportional**: Burns scale with platform usage
- **Transparent**: Each burn shows exact calculation and rationale

### **3. Market-Standard Economics**

**Your Requirement**: "Not 10x market standard"

**Implementation**:
- **Target**: Exactly $3.00 RPM (YouTube competitive)
- **Realistic**: Based on 25,000 monthly views per creator
- **Sustainable**: Balanced with platform revenue capacity
- **Adjustable**: Can test different RPM targets (2.0-5.0 range)

### **4. Real-Time Formula Display**

**Your Requirement**: "Show formula realtime so we can understand how it works"

**Implementation**:
- **Live Calculations**: Every formula updates as you change parameters
- **Step-by-Step**: Shows each calculation step with current values
- **Visual Charts**: Interactive graphs of formula relationships
- **Comprehensive**: Covers dynamic rewards, economics, and burns

## üßÆ **How to Use the Calculator**

### **Step 1: Set Platform Parameters**
```
Daily Users: 15,000 (default, adjustable 1K-100K)
Creator %: 2.5% (realistic ratio)
Curator %: 8.0% (engagement ratio)
Content/Creator: 1.8 pieces per day
```

### **Step 2: Configure Token Economics**
```
Base Price: $0.10 (reference price)
Current Price: $0.135 (35% appreciation example)
Target RPM: $3.00 (YouTube competitive)
Monthly ARPU: $6.00 (industry standard)
```

### **Step 3: Adjust Dynamic Settings**
```
Price Adjustment Factor: 0.3 (your 30% rule)
Min Reward Ratio: 0.2 (20% floor protection)
Max Reward Ratio: 2.0 (200% ceiling protection)
Revenue Share: 55% (creator share of revenue)
```

### **Step 4: Analyze Results**
- **Revenue Coverage**: Should be 0.6-0.8x for healthy models
- **Token Supplement**: Shows % of creator payments from tokens
- **Reward Multiplier**: Shows current dynamic adjustment (0.92x at 35% appreciation)
- **Economic Health**: Overall sustainability assessment
